### CPSC 120

* Lab 2 Part 1

I enjoyed this lab, because it was sort of our introduction to clang and compiling of code. It was cool to see how running code works and the types of outputs it gives to the terminal. It was also one of the first introductions of Git and iâ€™ve always seen stuff on github but have never used it so it was cool to finally do so

* Lab 8 Part 2

I like this lab because it was our introduction to ifstream and ofstream. I thought it was cool that we could pull data from one file and use it within our program. It was also cool to be able to export information to another file. 

* Lab 6 Part 1

I found this lab interesting, because it was our first introduction to graphics in programming and we utilized dashes and bars to make a pattern in the terminal. I was very satisfied to see the code run properly and make the image just through a couple of for loops. It was a little frustrating to debug but once it was running it was cool to see.
